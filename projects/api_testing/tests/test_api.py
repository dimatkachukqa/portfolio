"""
Python requests with Pytest API Testing Project

This file contains pytest functions for testing the JSONPlaceholder API,
It uses CRUD operations alongside the requests library to automate API testing

Note: JSONPlaceholder provides mock endpoints,
so CRUD operations return valid responses without affecting real data.
